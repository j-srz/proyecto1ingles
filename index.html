            Our carbon footprint is the effect we have on the Earth by emitting
            greenhouse gases (both directly and indirectly). It's measured in
            tonnes of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere and does not paint our
            civilisation in a good light.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can't blame it all on huge machines and big corporations. You
            also pollute. In your day-to-day life, your small daily actions are
            leaving a trail and increasing the overall amount of CO2 in our
            environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are all (some much more so, some less so) threatening the
            sustainability of our planet. From using plastic bags to spraying
            deodorant, there are countless things we do without even realising
            that are continuously damaging the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often, we can make a huge personal contribution by assessing our
            habits and getting rid of those that we don't need, or replacing
            them with others that don't have the same environmental impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we look at how we can reduce our footprint, we should
            determine, in plain terms, our annual contribution to CO2 emissions
            in the atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's surprising to learn that a one-person household can produce
            more than 3 tonnes of CO2, solely through electricity consumption
            (excluding other energy sources). Similarly, an average-sized
            vehicle covering 15,000 km a year can emit 2.5 tonnes of CO2.

            Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew
            pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create
            electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage
            and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical
            poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm
            wildlife. Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are
            usually more polluted than the countryside, pollution can spread to
            remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and
            other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the
            middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of
            microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great
            Pacific Garbage Patch.

            Leaving the tap running while you brush your teeth, drinking bottled
            water and throwing chewing gum on the ground. These, and other
            everyday habits show that we are sometimes unaware of how we pollute
            the environment. Learn about the small daily habits you can change
            to benefit the planet.

            We are breaking a terrible record, one that has never occurred in
            the history of mankind. Animals and plants are becoming extinct
            thousands of times faster than they have done in the last 500
            million years and, according to the International Union for
            Conservation of Nature (IUCN), if we don't do something about it
            now, within a century we will have lost 67% of the currently
            endangered fauna and 99.9% will be in serious danger of extinction.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to a study conducted by the University of Aarhus in
            Denmark in 2018, the damage will be so devastating that the planet
            will need between 3 and 5 million years to recover from the sixth
            mass extinction in history and the first caused by mankind. The
            effects of development, agriculture and industrial livestock
            farming, forest destruction and CO2 emissions, among other actions,
            are speeding up the loss of biodiversity due to global warming,
            desertification and the pollution of oceans and rivers.

            Before we performed these calculations, it seemed like it would take
            a large group of people to emit 1 tonne of CO2, but now we have
            realised the significant individual impact of our actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If these actions can have such a huge effect on the health of our
            planet, it's clear that if we correct them, we can create a
            reduction of equal impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want our planet to survive, something has to give. We need to

                    <li>
                      Only use the washing machine and dishwasher on a full
                      load. Avoid using the tumble dryer.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Use extension leads with switches to avoid phantom power
                      consumption, which is costing you EUR 5 a month.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Use a flask to keep drinks hot instead of reheating them
                      in the microwave or on the hob.
                    </li>

                    <li>If you haven't already, switch to LED bulbs.</li>

                    <li>
                      Keep your fridge clean (with no ice build-up) and away
                      from heat sources. Don't put hot food in the fridge.
                    </li>

                    <li>Take quick showers instead of long baths.</li>

                    <li>
                      Turn down your heating: lowering the temperature by just
                      1°C results in 300 kg less CO2 emissions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Turn down your air conditioning: consumption of 1 kWh
                      represents emissions of 650 g of CO2.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Always look for appliances with the best energy efficiency

                    In addition to the high levels of harmful gases emitted
                    during their production, plastics and microplastics are
                    practically indestructible and have a huge impact on
                    ecosystems. This is why we must:

                    <li>
                      Only use paper or fabric bags, reusing them as much as
                      possible.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      When making purchases, always opt for products in
                      cardboard, metal or glass packaging. If you can't avoid
                      buying plastic packaging, choose larger sizes;
                      manufacturing a 1.5l bottle generates less pollution than
                      a 0.5l bottle.

                    A good portion of the CO2 emissions come from exhaust pipes.
                    Specifically, a vehicle powered by fossil fuel (petrol,
                    diesel) is the least efficient as it is the one that
                    generates most emissions per passenger transported:

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Use non-polluting vehicles: bicycles and scooters, or
                      public transport in those cases and cities where fleets
                      with low or zero emissions have been made available.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Avoid using the car for short journeys and keep it in good
                      condition so that the emissions match those designed by
                      the manufacturer.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Switch to electric or hybrid vehicles wherever possible.

                    The electric car is undoubtedly the future of
                    sustainability. In Endesa we already have a 100% green
                    tariff for which you pay the same every month regardless of
                    your consumption.
